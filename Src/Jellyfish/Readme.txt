What if you can run a Windows desktop application like a web application?



1. Open a browser, go to application's server home page, download the Launcher (as small as 8k), launcher it after it is downloaded.

2. The launcher starts to download the minimum amount of the application's files and launches the application.

3. The application will download missing files (DLLs etc.) when it needs to use them. 

4. Quit the application. Next time you can start from browser, or Launcher or the application itself.
